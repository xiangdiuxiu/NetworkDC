This provides source codes and datasets in our paper 
"Inferring nonlinear gene regulatory networks from gene expression data based on distance correlation"

The source codes in "src" folder:
makeDCmatrix.R -- compute distance correlation for each pair of genes
testDC.R -- compare our result with the real network
testMI.R --  compute MI for each pair of genes and compare with a real network

The datasets in "data" folder. In each subdirectory, there are two files, one for gene expression data and the other for the true network structure. 
Dream3 -- dream3 data, including 10 genes, 50 genes and 100 genes
SOS -- SOS network
Noise -- datasets generated by using SynTReN
