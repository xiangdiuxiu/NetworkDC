#Inferring nonlinear gene regulatory networks from gene expression data based on distance correlation#

This page provides free R sourced codes and datasets used in our paper.

Introduction: Nonlinear dependence is general in regulation mechanism of gene regulatory networks (GRNs). Powerful dependence measurement is of utmost importance in the area of the nonlinear GRNs inference. Distance correlation (DC), is a natural generalization of the classical Pearson correlation, is an efficient tool in evaluating the nonlinear correlation and has appealing features, such as: the calculation is quite simple and without any distribution assumption et al. Here, we incorporate DC into GRNs inference.
